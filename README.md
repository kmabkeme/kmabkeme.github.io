This website https://kmabkeme.github.io/ is a calculator for figuring whether it makes sense to do what is called a "backdoor" Roth IRA conversion.

In a backdoor Roth IRA conversion, a person can transfer funds from a regular IRA, which may have tax-deductible funds or non-deductible
funds which have already had taxes paid on them. Any tax-deductible funds that are converted to a Roth IRA must have taxes paid on them
when they are converted. Then, as investments in a Roth IRA, the capital gains are not taxed. This is different from a regular IRA where the
initial investment as well as the capital gains are taxed when they are withdrawn during retirement.

This calculator is an attempt to make a tool that is a bit easier to understand then these three calculators:
